# Lirium Client
This client was released on Haze.yt around December 2022. The client sucked, and the only real features were the Cubecraft disabler and the bare minimum of Intave bypasses. Since there weren't really other bypasses other than for Cubecraft (not counting the KillAura, which technically bypassed Intave, which, to be fair, is way more than most "real" "multi server" clients have, especially when it could actually win some fights), this client's entire thing was the afore mentioned Disabler, which you could easily get in clients with basic Custom Disabler, and the rest of clients got it after the method got popular. What was the method, you may ask? It was sending a null place packet. ðŸ’€

So let's recap this: the only worthwhile feature in this client was a module that sent a single packet every tick, and the rest of the bypasses were vanilla or mediocre, even for a free client.

I can't tell you exactly how much it cost since it got taken down from haze.yt and I don't want to go through an hour of haze content, which I don't even understand (since I don't speak German), to find a price point.

As mentioned in the description, this is not some kind of insane leak that shocked the community, as Kroko made the repository public one day and then deleted it or re-privated it again, as he did with Koks and Atom before.

Apparently, compensation for the people who bought the client was given out, so I wouldn't call this a scam, and I don't want any drama with the developers. I just wanted to preserve this so all Minecraft cheat archiving isn't in the hands of some skids reuploading cracks on Masterof13FPS and poorly managed Discord servers.
